          <li>4 cups seafood or vegetable broth</li>
          <li>2 cups heavy cream (or half-and-half)</li>
          <li>2 cups corn kernels (fresh or frozen)</li>
          <li>1 lb (450 g) shrimp, peeled & deveined</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning (or seafood seasoning)</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
          <li>Salt & freshly ground pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (for garnish)</li>
          <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Sauté the vegetables:</strong> In a large pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onion, celery, carrots, and red pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent and the veggies begin to soften, about 5–6 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.</li>
          <li><strong>Make the roux:</strong> Sprinkle the flour over the veggies and stir continuously for 1–2 minutes, until the flour is lightly golden and coats the vegetables.</li>
          <li><strong>Add liquids & corn:</strong> Slowly whisk in the broth, making sure there are no lumps. Add the corn, Old Bay seasoning, and smoked paprika. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes—this thickens the base and cooks the corn.</li>
          <li><strong>Cook the shrimp:</strong> Season the shrimp lightly with salt and pepper and drop them into the simmering chowder. Cook until the shrimp turn pink and opaque, about 3–4 minutes.</li>
          <li><strong>Finish with cream:</strong> Reduce heat to low. Stir in the heavy cream and warm through for 2 more minutes—do not boil once the cream is added. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, or a squeeze of lemon.</li>
          <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Ladle into bowls, sprinkle with chopped parsley, and pass lemon wedges at the table for a bright finish.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tips & Variations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Smoky bacon boost:</strong> Start by rendering 4 slices chopped bacon in the pot, remove it before adding butter, then sprinkle crispy bits over each bowl.</li>
          <li><strong>Thicker chowder:</strong> Swap half the broth for milk and simmer an extra 5 minutes before adding cream.</li>
          <li><strong>Shellfish swap:</strong> Replace shrimp with bite-sized scallops or a medley of clams and mussels (add clams/mussels at step 3 and cook until they open).</li>
          <li><strong>Spice it up:</strong> A pinch of cayenne or a dash of hot sauce adds a nice kick.</li>
          <li><strong>Herb notes:</strong> Fresh thyme or chives make a lovely garnish in place of parsley.</li>
